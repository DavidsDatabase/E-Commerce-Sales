# E-Commerce Sales

### Project Overview

E-Commerce has become a new method in supporting business development. Businesses can look to sell products or services online to yield more sales and profits. E-commerce has revolutionized the way people shop and consume products and services. With the press of a button, whether on the computer or mobile phone, consumers can purchase their products with ease and without having to set foot inside the store. This project's goals are to find the top performing products purchased from many customers, the top spending customers, and where most of these purchases are made from. 

### About the Data

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data loading and Joining
2. Data Cleaning and Sorting
3. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. How was the sales trend over the months?
2. What are the most frequently purchased products?
3. How many products does the customer purchase in each transaction?
4. What are the most profitable segment customers?

### Results/Findings

1. We see that the early months of the year have constant sales from 12/2018 all the way to 08/2019. Afterwards, we start to see an upwards trend in the amount of sales from 09/2019 to 11/2019. Between 08/2019 and 09/2019, there was an **increase** of **42%** in sales.

3. Customer **14585** had purchased **1,111** products, followed by customer **16219** with **747** products, and customer **15492** with **730** products. Many customers amongst the list had made other orders, but these orders represents the highest amount of products purchased in 1 transaction.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

The business should focus primarily on supplying stock for the top 10 best performing products. These products would be sold quickly to customers without a worry. Focusing on the top 10 customers would yield the most profit as these customers had the largest sales throughout the year. 


### Limitations

This dataset did not provide profit margins or product costs. This is important in determining which products actually yielded profit or loss. This also ties to which customers have the best profit return rate. Another limitation that would greatly improve the analysis would be to categorize the products into sub-categories. This can help in determining which categories do better in terms of profit. December 2019 sales were removed from this dataset because the dataset only had 10 days worth of data which would lead to an unclear analysis.
